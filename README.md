# Revolutionizing-Wine-Quality-Prediction


ðŸ”¹ Data Exploration: I analyzed a dataset containing various attributes of red wine samples, such as volatile acidity and citric acid. I checked for missing values, calculated descriptive statistics, and visualized the wine quality distribution.

ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I investigated the relationships between different attributes and wine quality using bar plots. I also created a correlation heatmap to understand the interdependencies among variables.

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing: I separated the data into input features and quality labels. Then, I transformed the quality labels into binary classes for simplified analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Model Training and Evaluation: I split the data into training and testing sets, trained a RandomForestClassifier model, and evaluated its performance using accuracy score.

ðŸ”¹ Prediction on New Data: Finally, I showcased how the trained model can predict wine quality for new instances by providing an example input and obtaining the corresponding prediction.

ðŸŒŸ Overall, this project allowed me to gain insights into wine quality factors and build a machine learning model for accurate predictions. If you're interested in wine analysis or want to explore machine learning applications, feel free to reach out!
